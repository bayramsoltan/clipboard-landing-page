# Frontend Mentor - Clipboard landing page solution

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution to the [Clipboard landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Flexbox, Responsive Web design</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  transform:translate(50,50);
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
